ENS Identity Search is a festive, user-friendly tool that reveals your comprehensive Web3 identity, connecting your ENS profile with other digital identities.

Using the magic 🪄 of  **@ensdomains/thorin** and **@ensdomains/ui**, I've created a merry and bright tool that lets you search for any Web3 identity with ease. Just enter an ENS name or Ethereum address, and voilà! You'll be greeted with a detailed **profile of the ENS identity**, complete with connections to other identities in the blockchain universe, such as **Lens profile**, **Farcaster**, and **Unstoppable Domains**.

But wait, there's more! In the spirit of Christmas, I've decked the tool with two themes - a light, snowy wonderland and a cozy, dark winter night. So whether you're basking in the glow of Christmas lights or enjoying the peaceful dark of a winter's evening, ENS Identity Search is ready to bring you joy and discovery. 🔍

Hope this tool brings as much joy to you as the holiday season does. Merry searching, and may your digital identity be as bright and merry as this festive time! 🎄
